# Word-Race:

This above mentioned website is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have tried to make it fancy by using typography somewhere with a fancy looking background color. I have used autofocus on the content box which auto focus on the typing section part in the webpage.  I have used timer, level, WPM, CPM, Error, Score, High Score and Accuracy for the feedback. User will be able to see the current character and those characters which are typed out will be shown as canceled (used text decoration to pass a line through). I have provided Instructions as well in the page which is just aligned above the content box, so when the user scrolls down the page they will be able to view instructions first. I have used footer tag to put the footer content in it which seems to be an important part of a website. The typing box/content box is responsive. I have used div tag and in each div tag I have created a class to make it easy to select for CSS and JavaScript code. I have CSS a lot in my code to make it look attractive and try to enhance the feature of typing. The timer will automatically start when the person starts typing the provided paragraph and once the time are up it will not accept typing anymore. User then must click on the try again button to restart typing. I have also used download attribute to download the source code of the website. I have provided a favicon using the link tag. I have hosted this website on Netlify.
